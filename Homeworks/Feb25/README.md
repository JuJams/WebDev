- # Information Architecture Key Notes

Information Architecture (IA) forms the foundation of effective web design through thoughtful organization and structure. At its core, IA utilizes hierarchical structures, sequential organization, and matrix relationships to create intuitive navigation systems. These systems include global and local navigation, breadcrumbs, and site maps that guide users through content. The best practices focus on logical content grouping with clear categories and meaningful labels that reduce cognitive load. Information hierarchy emphasizes primary content prominence while maintaining clear visual organization of secondary elements. When implementing IA, card sorting helps organize content from a user-centered perspective, while site mapping provides visual representation of navigation paths. User testing validates the structure and ensures the navigation flows effectively. These elements work together to create websites that are both functional and user-friendly.
