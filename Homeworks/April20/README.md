# Final Project Proposal – Magic Portfolio Website

## Concept / Theme

For my final project, I’m building a **"magic website"** — an immersive, out-of-the-box portfolio for a front-end or web developer to showcase skills in an expressive, maximalist way. 

This won’t be a typical grid-layout portfolio. Instead I wanted to try bridging the gap between traditional portfolio websites and fancy animated/gamey websites.

The website will introduce the me and showcase work/projects, and create a lasting impression through bold visuals and UX.

## Visual & UX Inspiration

### Inspiration Sites:
- [Bryant’s Portfolio](https://bryant.codes/) – Loved the sketchy, maximalist aesthetic and bold interactive style.
- [Gloria Lo’s Portfolio](https://www.glorialo.design) – Clean, bold typography and elegant animations that communicate personality.

##  HTML/CSS/JS Concepts to Use

Here are the key front-end concepts I plan to use:

- `CSS Transforms & Transitions`: For hover effects and animated cards.
- `JavaScript Event Listeners`: For interactivity on buttons and links.
- `Scroll-triggered Animations`: Content that fades or slides in as users scroll.
- `DOM Manipulation`: For toggling between project views, themes, or overlays.
- `Flexbox/Grid`: To manage layout across pages and sections.
- `CSS Variables`: For light/dark or theme toggles.
- `Spline` and `ScrollMagic` for more advanced timeline animations and 3D animations. [Tutorial link](https://windmaomao.medium.com/bring-3d-content-to-websites-with-spline-5eb8c2ce3ab8)
