# Portfolio Website

## Concept/Theme of the Site  
I am designing a **portfolio website** that includes artistic elements, such as **Spline** (an embed that renders 3D designs). The goal is to create an engaging and visually appealing personal portfolio.

## Inspiration  
Here are some existing portfolio websites that inspired my design:  

- [Portfolio 1](https://www.lremes.com) – I like the **font** and the **engaging style**.  
- [Portfolio 2](https://www.anuraghav.com/#Home) – I admire the **artistic style** and **visually appealing content showcase**.

## Concepts & Skills  

### Skills I Will Use  
- **HTML** (structure with `<div>` elements)  
- **CSS** (styling and layout)  

### Skills I Need to Learn  
- **HTML + JavaScript** (for interactive elements and functionality)
