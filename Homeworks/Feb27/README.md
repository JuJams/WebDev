I found Alex Galloway's StarryNight (1999), an interactive digital artwork eye-catching. It turns the night sky into a form of small flickering dots on a screen. These dots are just simple pixels that move and change when a user interacts with them instead of staying still like the real stars. It was not just about the visuals I found them interesting but it was also the way to look through an archive of emails on the database from an online discussion for digital artists. Each email had a glowing dot showing up on the screen and the more people read that email, the brighter the glowing dot got as an indication. Users could also click on keywords to match with related emails to form constellations of discussions.

I think this is really cool as it was not just simple browsing through emails but it was a more interactive experience. The project reminds me of websites that use user input to modify the website in real-time. It is also like a nostalgic experience to a time when sites were more outlandish, less polished and pushed the boundaries of design.
